Project: Simple Tweeter

Completed:

1. Implemented Devise authentication: users can register, log in, and log out.
2. Unregistered users can only view the list of tweets.
3. Registered users can:
a) View a list of all tweets (sorted from newest to oldest).
b) Add and delete their own tweets.
c) Retweet and undo retweets.
d) Like and unlike tweets.
e) View tweets from users they follow.
f) View retweeted tweets.
Creating and deleting tweets are integrated with the channel for real-time updates.

To Do:

1. Allow users to add comments to tweets.
2. Improve the styling.
3. Enable users to view tweets with the most likes.
4. Add a feature to display a list of all users (sorted in some meaningful way).
5. Allow users to find and view all tweets from a specific user.
6. Implement a search feature to find tweets containing specific keywords.
7. Add tags (or categories) for tweets.
8. Enable users to view tweets by category.
